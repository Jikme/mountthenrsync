# mountthenrsync
 MountThenRsync is a apple script that attempts to mount a network drive if not mounted and then calls a script to run rsync. We found rsync can create folders locally and send backups to that path instead of the remote machine if the destination path in the rsync command is a network drive that is not mounted prior to running rsync. It supports Apple Script 2.7.
